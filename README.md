# hello-world
Starting a database project to make thinks easier into sports training, competition and organization.
IÂ´m a proffesional in sports and I always try to improve "things", always wanted to learn to code to make the work (mine and my crew) but always failed. And try again, making a bad joke: a professional "tryagainer".
New commit: design a web and integer a database.
